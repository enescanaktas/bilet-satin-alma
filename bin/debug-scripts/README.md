Debug and test helper scripts (archived)

This folder contains helper scripts that were used for local testing and debugging (simulate_buy, test_quickbuy, etc.). They were moved out of `bin/` to avoid cluttering production scripts.

If you need to run any of these, run them from this folder or move them back to `bin/`.
